## My process

To kickstart the development process, I began by creating the HTML markup for the card component.

Moving on to the stylesheet, I took a systematic approach to styling the component. I focused on one component at a time, ensuring its visual appearance and functionality before moving on to the next.

I also added media queries for the desktop view responsiveness

Throughout the process, I maintained a keen eye for aesthetics and user experience, striving to create a visually pleasing and intuitive QR code component. By following this systematic and meticulous approach, I ensured that every aspect of the design was thoughtfully implemented.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge, I learnt center items in a box with grid and place-items properties. Below is the code snippet I used for this.

```css
main{
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    padding: 20px;
}
```
